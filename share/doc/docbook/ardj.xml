			<title>Description</title>

			<para><command>ardj</command> is a collection of tools that can be used to run a full featured fully
			automated internet radio station. It is designed to stay alive even when there's nobody looking for it from
			the administrative point of view: bad music will go away, fresh music will be found, as long as listeners
			care.</para>

			<para><command>ardj</command> uses an SQLite database to store the runtime data, a tiny web server to access
			it, an XMPP (Jabber) bot for runtime management and to interact with the audience, and a plugin which feeds
			<command>ices</command>.Â  The web server which is used as the database interface is built on
			<application>web.py</application> and requires zero configuration; it's main purpose is to prevent
			deadlocking the SQLite database by synchronizing multiple processes accessing it.</para>

			<para>Buzzword bingo: streaming, MP3, SQLite, Jabber, robotics, Last.fm, Libre.fm, scrobbling, jingles,
			prerolls.</para>

			<para>This document is a work in progress. The complete documentation is available on the website.</para>

			<title>Setting up a station</title>

			<para>To run a streaming radio station you will need the following components: <command>icecast2</command>,
			<command>ices</command> and <command>ardj</command>.</para>

			<para><command>Icecast2</command> is the multiplexor, it has little brain. Its main job is to receive a
			stream from a source (<command>ices</command>) and retransmits it to as many listening clients as there are.
			It's like a proxy for multimedia streams. It is a separate product and has nothing to do with
			<command>ardj</command>.</para>

			<para><command>Ices</command> is the stream source. It reads file names from a playlist, loads and decodes
			the files, cross-fades them nicely, encodes the result to the configured format (typically MP3) and sends
			the result to <command>icecast</command>. This is also an independent component that has little to do with
			<command>ardj</command>. It only uses the playlist plugin which <command>ardj</command> provides to read
			file names from the database instead of flat files.</para>

			<para><command>ardj</command> is the virtual brain of your radio station. It maintains playlists, picks the
			music and jingles, collects feedback from the audience, adjusts track priorities and so on.</para>

			<title>Main concepts</title>

			<para>This is a sort of glossary.</para>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term>Jingles</term>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term>Rotation priority</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>There are two track weights: the real one and the running one.</para>
					</listitem>

			<title>Command line options</title>

			<para>The first parameter to <command>ardj</command> is the command. Some commands require additional
			arguments, they are described below.</para>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>add-incoming-tracks</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Looks for audio files in the <option>incoming_path</option> folder. What's found is
						<emphasis>moved</emphasis> to the database, source files are deleted. If the source can't be
						deleted, it's ignored (to prevent adding it multiple times).</para>

						<para>Only files with extensions <filename>.mp3</filename> and <filename>.ogg</filename> are
						added, other files are ignored.</para>

						<para>When the files are imported, artist names and track titles are read from the metadata,
						other common tags are ignored. One uncommon tag which is used is <varname>ardj</varname>: with
						it you can preset track labels. Example format: "ardj=1;labels=music,rock" (this is the value,
						including the "ardj=1" prefix, which designates metadata format).</para>

						<para>This is similar to the jabber command <command>upload</command>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>config</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Opens the configuration file for editing with your default editor. The editor name is read
						from the <varname>EDITOR</varname> environment variable. If there's nothing, the
						<command>editor</command> command is used.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>db-console</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Opens the database console. This is useful if you need to perform some low-level
						operations and don't want to type the full database path.</para>

						<para>This command only works if you have <command>sqlite3</command> installed.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>db-init</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Initializes the database structure by creating tables and indexes which are missing. This
						command is normally used by the installation script only. You might only need to use it if you
						deleted the database file and want to create a new one from scratch.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>db-purge</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Removes dead data from the database. Dead data is labels that are no longer used and files
						which correspond to deleted tracks.</para>

					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term>
						<option>download-artist</option>
						<replaceable>artist_name</replaceable>
					</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Schedules retrieving more tracks by the specified artist. This only adds a request to the
						database, without immediately downloading anything.</para>

						<para>This is similar to the jabber command <command>download</command>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>find-new-tracks</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Starts searching for new music. It first selects artists that have tracks rated above
						average, then looks for their music on Last.fm and Jamendo. Tracks which can be downloaded and
						which aren't in the database are downloaded and added to it.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>fix-artist-names</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Looks up all artists in the Last.fm database and corrects their names when necessary. This
						usually implies case correction, but can sometime change the name completely (which is still
						correct unless Last.fm fails drasticly).</para>

						<para>You typically run this command on a nightly basis.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>help</option></term>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>mark-hitlist</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Marks approximately 10 best tracks which have the "music" label with the "hitlist" label.

						number 10 (i.e. they all share 10th place)..</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term>
						<option>mark-liked-by</option>

				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>mark-long</option></term>
					<listitem>

				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>mark-orphans</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Marks tracks that don't belong to a playlist with the "orphan" label. This can help you

				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>serve</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Starts the Web API server, which typically listens to localhost:8080. This server is used
						by the <application>ices</application> plugin to get names of files to play and by the jabber

					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>update-track-lengths</option></term>

						useful if you change files in the <option>musicdir</option> folder manually, or if you had a
						failure and resorted to backups.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>update-track-weights</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Updates real track weights according to user votes.</para>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry id="jabber-queue">
					<term><command>queue</command></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>Adds a track to the manual playlist, which have the highest priority.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>
			</variablelist>

			<title>Configuration</title>

			<para>There is one configuration wile which contains all settings.Â  This file is named
			<filename>/etc/ardj.yaml</filename>, if you're installing system wide, or
			<filename>$HOME/.config/ardj/ardj.yaml</filename> if you're testing locally.</para>

			<variablelist>
				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>musicdir</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>This option defines the folder where the music will be stored. Files in this folder have
						scrambled names, related to the file contents' MD5 checksum, e.g.
						<filename>2/4/24a141bfaaae48969901a9ab1206dc76.mp3</filename>. This is <emphasis>not</emphasis>

						this folder, send the <command>upload</command> command to the jabber bot.</para>

						<para>When files are added to the database, only two common tags are read and used: "artist" and
						"title". One uncommon tag is "ardj", with which you can preset internal metadata, such as
						labels. Syntax example: "ardj=1;labels=music,rock" (normally you only set the labels this way,
						other options are currently ignored).</para>

						<para>Default location is <filename>/var/lib/ardj/incoming</filename>.</para>
					</listitem>
				</varlistentry>

				<varlistentry>
					<term><option>incoming_labels</option></term>
					<listitem>
						<para>With this parameter you can set default labels for new files. This typically has labels
						which will later help you find unsorted music and label it properly. If you have a playlist for
						incoming unsorted music, you can also specify it here.</para>
